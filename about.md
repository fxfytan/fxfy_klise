Hi! I'm Felyx and/or Fayth, and I'm a science writer and recently-minted Caltech Ph.D. I did my thesis research into animal regeneration from an evolutionary-developmental perspective, or how animals make and re-make themselves. 

My writing is typically about the stories we tell ourselves about science— how we construct them, who gets to tell them, how the socio-cultural zeigeist influences it, how humanity— our fears, anxieties, hopes and passions— inexorably bleeds into it. I won the National Academy of Sciences Schmidt Prize for Excellence in Science Communication [https://www.schmidtfutures.com/national-academies-announce-inaugural-recipients-of-eric-and-wendy-schmidt-awards-for-excellence-in-science-communications-totaling-600000/] for two [https://caltechletters.org/viewpoints/orchids-science-and-culture] essays [https://www.thexylom.com/post/no-more-free-kelp-in-northern-californiahttps://www.thexylom.com/post/no-more-free-kelp-in-northern-california]. The rest of my writing can be found here [fxfy.github.io/writing]

I'm **open to work** and currently freelancing, though I'd love to hear about any fulltime science communication opportunities as well. 

**Evergreen interests:**
Weird animals and/or the weird things animals do, obscure science history, neurodivergence and disability, social impacts of science and technology, environment and climate

**Other types of work:**
Scientific manuscript/grant editing, research, factchecking, data analysis
